2~5 data are what we need to train the neural net. In total they are about only 850MB.


1.matrix_select.mat

matrix M 

column 1: image id number
column 2: largest segmention area index number
column 3: 2nd largest segmention area index number
column 4: area 1 
column 5: area 2
column 6: category 1
column 7: category 2

Notation:
the image id number is the same as image name(jpg)/mask name(png)/ground truth name(png)
column 2 4 6 corresponds to the largest sengmentation.
column 3 5 7 corresponds to the 2nd largest one.


2.boundingbox_matrix.mat

column 1: image id number
column 2: x
column 3: y
column 4: w 
column 5: h

3.deformed masks are stored in maask_def folder.
The filenames are named: deformation_'imageid'.png

Note:the png are 0/255 uint8 binary value, if you want double you can divide it by 255

imageid range from 42 to 398339. the imageid should be retrives from the first column of matrix_select.mat or boundingbox_matrix.mat

4. ground truth segmentations are stored in groundtruth folder.
The filenames are named: groundt_'imageid'.png

Note:the png are uint8 type. The value of a pixel is 0 if it is backgroud and is category_id if it is foreground.

category_id range from 1 to 90. There are 80 categories in total.

5. training images are stored in images folder.
There are 13876 images in total. 
They are named from COCO_val2014_000000000042.jpg to COCO_val2014_000000398339.jpg
So, there are a lot of 0 in the image file name but there is no extra 0 in mask or ground truth file names.

6. maskgenerate.m readimage.m select.m select2.m and rbfwarp2d.m are created by ourselves. other files are provided by coco dataset.
